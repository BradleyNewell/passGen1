# passGen1
A basic password generator which outputs a 32 character 'password' from a given string of both alphanumerical characters as well as symbols.

# passGen2.0
This is a refactored and vastly improved implementation of the original script, As well as writing generated passwords to a .txt document
and the source code has been updated and the code itself has been improved for readability.

I have also added more variations for the generated password (Now with added upper case) and have also broken the initial strings up into 
their own variables.

I do plan to further update this project in future and I am looking to add some form of GUI for ease of use

# PasswordGen3 29/09/2019
I've decided to keep the other earlier versions of this project up as a small personal reminder of the progress I've made and may continue to add new iterations in the future.

# PasswordGeneratorGUI 25/06/2020
Final version complete with GUI
